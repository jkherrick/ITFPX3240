    <p>Sloths are a marvel of evolutionary design. Their slow metabolism and herbivorous diet mean they don't need to expend much energy, a perfect strategy for life high in the rainforest canopy. Their unique hair even grows a symbiotic algae, providing them with camouflage from predators. There are two main types of sloths: the two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth, each with its own distinctive features and behaviors.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Unfortunately, sloths face many threats, primarily from habitat destruction. As their rainforest homes are cleared for agriculture and development, sloths are left vulnerable. Many organizations are working to protect these gentle creatures, rehabilitating injured sloths and reintroducing them into protected areas. You can find more information about how to help on our Blog page.</p>
