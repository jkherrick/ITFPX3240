<p>Sloth Central is a website dedicated to all things sloth. The site came into being after its proprietress, Kate Herrick, saw her first sloth in Manuel Antonio National Park in Costa Rica. Kate writes about sloths, including habitat loss, so-called "rescue" organizations that are in reality nothing more than tourist traps and sloths in popular culture. Sloth Central invites you to submit photos of sloths, your personal observations about these fascinating creatures, and links to other sites dedicated to all things sloth.</p>
